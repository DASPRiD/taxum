/**
 * Creates a request handler that processes an HTTP request using the provided
 * extractors and function.
 *
 * This allows you to separate request data parsing (via extractors) from
 * business logic (the handler), making route definitions cleaner and more
 * type-safe.
 *
 * You can either pass in each extractor individually as positional arguments
 * or all extractors as a single array as the first argument.
 *
 * ## Behavior
 *
 * - All extractors are executed in parallel via `Promise.all()`.
 * - If an extractor throws, the error is propagated to the routerâ€™s
 *   error handler.
 * - The order of extractor definitions determines the order of arguments
 *   passed to the handler.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { extractHandler } from "@taxum/core/routing";
 * import { pathParam, json } from "@taxum/core/extract";
 * import { z } from "zod";
 *
 * const handler = extractHandler(
 *     pathParam(z.uuid()),
 *     json(z.object({ name: z.string() }})),
 *     (id, body) => {
 *         // do something with `id` and `body`
 *     },
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { extractHandler } from "@taxum/core/routing";
 * import { pathParam, json } from "@taxum/core/extract";
 * import { z } from "zod";
 *
 * const handler = extractHandler(
 *     [
 *         pathParam(z.uuid()),
 *         json(z.object({ name: z.string() }})),
 *     ],
 *     (id, body) => {
 *         // do something with `id` and `body`
 *     },
 * );
 * ```
